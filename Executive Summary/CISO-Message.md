# Message from the CISO

Cybersecurity is not just about technology — it's about resilience, trust, and business continuity.

As CISO, my mission is to create a secure environment that enables growth while proactively managing risk. This handbook reflects our commitment to security maturity, operational excellence, and long-term strategy.

Whether you are a board member, partner, or stakeholder, know this: our cybersecurity program is designed not just to protect, but to lead.
