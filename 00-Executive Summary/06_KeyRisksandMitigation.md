#Key Risks and Mitigation
Effective risk management is critical to the organizationâ€™s overall cybersecurity posture. The following risks have been identified as high-priority due to their potential to impact operations, regulatory compliance, and brand reputation. Each risk is paired with current and planned mitigation strategies.

- **Business Impact**: Potential data breach, regulatory non-compliance, insider threat exposure.
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Level**: High
- **Current Mitigation**:
  - Role-based access controls (RBAC) implemented
